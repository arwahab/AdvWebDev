Every piece of the web application stack, from HTTP requests to browser-side scripts, comes with important yet subtle security consequences. To keep users safe, it is essential for developers to confidently navigate this landscape. In The Tangled Web, Michal Zalewski, one of the world's top browser security experts, offers a compelling narrative that explains exactly how browsers work and why they're fundamentally insecure. Rather than dispense simplistic advice on vulnerabilities, Zalewski examines the entire browser security model, revealing weak points and providing crucial information for shoring up web application security. You'll learn how to: * Perform common but surprisingly complex tasks such as URL parsing and HTML sanitization * Use modern security features like Strict Transport Security, Content Security Policy, and Cross-Origin Resource Sharing * Leverage many variants of the same-origin policy to safely compartmentalize complex web applications and protect user credentials in case of XSS bugs * Build mashups and embed gadgets without getting stung by the tricky frame navigation policy * Embed or host user-supplied content without running into the trap of content sniffing For quick reference, "Security Engineering Cheat Sheets" at the end of each chapter offer ready solutions to problems you're most likely to encounter. With coverage extending as far as planned HTML5 features, The Tangled Web will help you create secure web applications that stand the test of time.</p><p class="book-info"> Author: <span>Michal Zalewski</span>.

In Visual Design for the Web, author Penny McIntire shows novice Web designers how to use their tools--including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript--in conjunction with the principles of aesthetics and usability to become masters of their craft. Chapters begin with explanations of the terminology and techniques of web structures, then demonstrate how to apply the rules of design to create beautiful sites. The book: Illustrates how fundamental principles of design apply to the web Includes charts, diagrams, and graphics to enhance learning and retention Covers site analysis, navigation, layout, color, graphics, typography and forms Demonstrates multiple techniques for getting just the right look and feel for your web sites Focuses on the characteristics that make sites usable, engaging, and memorable</p><p class="book-info"> Author: <span>Penny McIntire</span>.

This has resulted in heavy projects that are difficult to manage and scale. This book will explain a new way to write web applications by treating the front-end as if it were a third-party (such as a mobile client). This book, written by a practicing MEAN developer, will take a holistic approach to using the MEAN JavaScript platform for creating modern web applications and lay out how to use the MEAN (Mongo, Express, AngularJS, and Node.js) set of tools to create a web application, from installation and setup of the tools to debugging and deploying your app. After an introduction to how web development is changing and the advantages of using the MEAN stack, the author jumps into an introduction to each tool and then dives into using the complete JavaScript-based application stack to build, test, and deploy apps.</p><p class="book-info"> Author: <span>Jeff Dickey</span>.

You’ll learn how to gain maximum value from Domain-Driven Design (DDD), define optimal supporting architecture, and succeed with modern UX-first design approaches. The author guides you through choosing and implementing specific technologies and addresses key user-experience topics, including mobile-friendly and responsive design. You’ll learn how to gain more value from existing Microsoft technologies such as ASP.NET MVC and SignalR by using them alongside other technologies such as Bootstrap, AJAX, JSON, and JQuery. By using these techniques and understanding the new ASP.NET Core 1.0, you can quickly build advanced web solutions that solve today’s problems and deliver an outstanding user experience. Microsoft MVP Dino Esposito shows you how to: Plan websites and web apps to mirror real-world social and business processes Use DDD to dissect and master the complexity of business domains Use UX-Driven Design to reduce costs and give customers what they want Realistically compare server-side and client-side web paradigms Get started with the new ASP.NET Core 1.0 Simplify modern visual webpage construction with Bootstrap Master practical, efficient techniques for running ASP.NET MVC projects Consider new options for implementing persistence and working with data models Understand Responsive Web Design’s pros, cons, and tradeoffs Build truly mobile-friendly, mobile-optimized websites About This Book For experienced developers and solution architects who want to plan and develop web solutions more effectively Assumes basic familiarity with the Microsoft web development stack</p><p class="book-info"> Author: <span>Dino Esposito</span>.
